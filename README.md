# Python_Challenge_ZR
For this challenge, we created python scripts for analysing the financial records of PyBank and the election result of PyPoll.
For the PyBank challenge we used “budget_data.csv” dataset to calculate following values. 
•	The total number of months included in the dataset.
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

next, for the PyPoll challenge we used “election_data.csv” dataset to calculate following values using a python script. 

•	The total number of votes cast
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The total number of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote

For both analyses, the respective CSV files contained in the 'Resources' folder were used, and the output was transferred in text file format to the 'Analysis' folder.
